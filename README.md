Taxi Booking System


Overview:  This is a project about developing an application to provide transportation services to individuals and groups through services of taxi, pooling, and others among commute. This project was developed using Python 3.9 using Visual Studio Code. 

Problem Statement: To create a python application with implementation of design patterns and on the basis of UML diagrams for the same. Requirements mentioned in the project brief should be covered using concepts of OOP and solving the problem.

Problem Solution To develop the application based on OOP paradigm and application requirements. It was developed in Visual Studio Code using Python as its primary and only language. This application will function as a service provider to taxi transportation from one place to another at many levels of living. All of them work in sync because all the relevant information taken by the admin from the user.

Software requirement: This development process included various software such as VS Code for the Coding part, MySQlite for database connectivity and Lucid charts to create the class diagrams. Although this wasnâ€™t a particularly ground breaking application. It can be said that a desktop application for small scale with my SQLite would be a reasonable application to start off with. It can be used in various O/S in this case in Windows 10. This was developed in Visual Studio code with necessary plugin and extensions with a database file for storing bookings. 

Modules: I Imported the required libraries into the coding workspace. Imports such as tkinter, sqlite3 and a couple other GUI related libraries. One drawback of this IDE is its lack of importing default libraries. I started off with devising a development plan, as it was my first time working with python, I answered certain basic questions like, how was I supposed to start, what components should I use. For instance, here I used pyhon 3.9 with sqlite, python and tkinter extensions. Then I started with writing down the code for it. As planned, I did not want it too complicated, so I had minimum files to avoid chaos decrease maintenance. After that I made sure I fulfilled all of requirement programs as asked, and tested it and made changes. 


Execution steps: This application does not have any complex steps to run it. simply download the zip folder, extract the files onto your computer. after extracting the files, move on with opening the application in the dezired IDE (VS Code recomended). The '.py' files aren't linked together for expandibility and for users like you to make changes to it. Try linking the files and run the program (recomended). To run the program, you can either right click each '.py' file and execute them or if you have access, you can type 'python appointment.py runserver' for the appointment.py file. 'python booking.py runserver' for the booking.py file and so on.
